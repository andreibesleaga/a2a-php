# A2A PHP Documentation

## Overview

A2A PHP is a complete implementation of the A2A Protocol v0.3.0. It provides a JSON-RPC transport, task lifecycle management, streaming through Server-Sent Events, and push notification configuration APIs. The project ships with a reference server (`examples/complete_a2a_server.php`) that passes every category of the A2A Test Compatibility Kit (TCK).

## Core capabilities

- **Protocol coverage**: Implements every JSON-RPC method defined by the v0.3.0 specification, including message send/stream, task retrieval, cancellation, resubscribe, and push notification management.
- **Strict validation**: All requests are checked for JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance (version, identifiers, and parameter containers). Malformed requests are rejected with precise error codes.
- **Task lifecycle**: Tasks persist history, artifacts, and metadata through the shared storage layer while exposing idempotent cancellation semantics.
- **Streaming**: The streaming server publishes JSON-RPC envelopes via SSE for both live message processing and reconnection snapshots.
- **Push notifications**: The push notification manager stores webhook configurations with list, get, set, and delete operations backed by persistent storage.
- **Authenticated extended card**: Optional extended agent card data becomes available when a request includes a token that matches `A2A_DEMO_AUTH_TOKEN`.

```

### Event flow

1. **Inbound request** – JSON-RPC body is validated and routed to the appropriate handler.
2. **Task coordination** – Task metadata, history, and artifacts are updated via `TaskManager` and stored through `Storage`.
3. **Handlers and execution** – Registered message handlers (or the default executor) generate results, statuses, and artifacts.
4. **Streaming** – Events are forwarded to `StreamingServer` when using `message/stream` or `tasks/resubscribe`.
5. **Responses** – JSON-RPC responses or SSE events are returned with consistent error handling.

## Compliance summary

| Category   | Status  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Mandatory  | All tests passing |
| Capability | All tests passing |
| Quality    | All tests passing |
| Features   | All tests passing |

Compliance is verified with the official TCK (`python3 ../a2a-tck/run_tck.py --category all`).

## Key behaviours guaranteed

- **JSON-RPC errors**: Invalid message payloads, unsupported part kinds, or malformed request envelopes are rejected with codes `-32600` or `-32602`.
- **Resubscribe snapshots**: `tasks/resubscribe` streams every stored history entry before emitting the current task snapshot.
- **Push config listing**: `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/list` returns an array of `{ taskId, pushNotificationConfig }` objects and supports optional filtering by task.
- **Task cancellation**: The first cancellation returns the task details; repeated requests report `TASK_NOT_CANCELABLE` to meet TCK expectations.
- **Authenticated card**: When the extended card feature is enabled, requests without credentials receive an authentication error and a `WWW-Authenticate` header.

## Running the reference server

```bash
php -S localhost:8081 examples/complete_a2a_server.php
```

Endpoints:

- `POST /` – JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint for all protocol methods.
- `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` – Public agent card document.
- `GET /server-info` – Diagnostic endpoint used by examples.

Set `A2A_DEMO_AUTH_TOKEN` to enable authenticated extended card responses.
